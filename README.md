# GoogleDirectionsApp
Shiny application front-end to the Google Directions API

Bethany Yollin has modified the open-source (but poorly maintained) `gmapsdistance` package. This is a copy of her work.
Kyle, Rick, and Mausam are investigating this as an alternative for work they are doing. We may also make additional
improvements to `gmapsdistance`.

Also, this is a great example of a professional shiny app! Open up the R project and the `ui.R` file in Rstudio and click
"Run App" (or type `shiny::runApp()` in the console).
