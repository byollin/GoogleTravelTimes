## Step 0: Set up a Google Account

You will need a Google Account to acquire a Google Maps API key. If you do not have a Google account, create one [here](https://myaccount.google.com/intro?hl=en-US).

## Step 1: Create a project in the Google Cloud Platform

Sign into your Google Account and go to the Google Cloud Platform Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/. If you have not activated this feature, agree to the Terms of Service and continue.

Click the "Select a project" dropdown menu on the upper left of the navigation bar.

## Step 2: Enable the Google Directions API for your Google project

Once your project is created, switch to the project from the "Select a project" dropdown menu on the upper left of the navigation bar.

In the popup, click on the project you created.

## Step 3: Create an API key for the Google Directions API

Enabling the Directions API will automatically take you to the Directions API dashboard. The dashboard allows you to monitor the API's usage, manage quotas and create API keys.

Navigate to the Credentials tab and click "Create credentials".

The API key is now created. You can copy and paste it in a safe location on your local desktop or access it from the Google Cloud Platform console at any time.

## Step 4: Enable billing for your Google project

The API key cannot be used until you enable billing for the Google project. API users are granted \$200 in free usage each month (approximately 40,000 requests). Beyond \$200, the requests to the Directions API are billed at $5.00 per additional 1,000 requests. See more pricing details [here](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/).

In the hamburger menu, click on "Billing".

On the next page, click "Link a billing account" and then "Create a billing account". You will need a credit card to complete this step. You will not be billed unless your API keys is used to make more than 40,000 requests in a single month. You can track the API's usage on the Directions API dashboard.
